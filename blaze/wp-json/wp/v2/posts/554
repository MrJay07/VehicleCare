When jump-starting a car there are certain caveats to charging your vehicle as the transfer of energy from one battery to another is not as simple as it seems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Connecting the battery terminals in reverse can cause serious damage to the battery itself, the electrical components, and even to yourself. Each terminal of a car battery uses 12V of current with positive and negative orientation. The cable on the positive terminal uses +12V while the one on the negative side uses -12V.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the positives and negatives are switched, the battery will try to compensate and make the negative 12 volts into a positive charge resulting in a huge surge of power and an enormous amount of heat to be produced. Needless to say, it will not be tolerated well by the system or the components within and depending on certain factors will incur damage that is mostly going to be severe and irreparable.&#xA0;&#xA0;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Damage_To_Jumper_Cables\"><\/span>Damage To Jumper Cables<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With an instant surge of electricity, the first to face the wrath and the consequence of an experiment would the jumper cables. the extreme heat produced will quickly melt the insulators on the jumper cables, clamping them forever on the battery which will be next in line as the plastic top will melt and bend.&#xA0;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Damage_To_Car_Battery\"><\/span>Damage To Car&#xA0; Battery<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The battery will be warped as the acidic fluids inside will boil from the extreme heat produced in the reaction.

Some cars may use lugs instead of clamps while some vehicle may require certain precautions as removing fuses or turning on defroster.

Each terminal can be identified using its color and the sign it uses. Connecting each terminal firmly is extremely important as a loose connection can hinder the process and not effectively charge the battery.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now with the basics out of the way, let&#x2019;s get to the very important matter that requires you to be extremely careful and a little on guard.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In electronics, the positive terminal is always connected first in order to avoid a high voltage meet of the semiconductors. When connecting the jumper cables always remember to first clamp cables from the positive terminal of the battery, which is usually red in color and is marked by a positive (+) sign, and only after properly connecting should you begin to connect the cables from the negative terminal, usually represented in black color with a minus (-) sign. Also, be wary of any metal object touching both terminals of the battery simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To better understand the implications of not connecting the positive first, let us assume, one has connected the positive terminal first.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When the negative terminal is connected, the whole chassis including the metal bolts holding it in place become grounded, upon which placing the positive terminal, connects the spanner with any common ground resulting in some sparks, splashes in a best-case scenario, and a dead battery or even an explosion of the unit in a nightmarish one.&#xA0;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Connecting the positive terminal first is recommended to ensure the spanner is not able to cause any damage even if it has met the chassis.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the contrary, it is recommended to start with the negative terminal while disconnecting the cables.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Can_Get_Electrocuted_While_Operating_A_Car_Battery\"><\/span>Can Get Electrocuted While Operating A Car Battery?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/wtamu.edu\/~cbaird\/sq\/2013\/11\/01\/why-is-a-12-volt-household-battery-harmless-but-the-shock-from-a-12-volt-car-battery-will-kill-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">current<\/a> from a 12VDC system is not massive enough that it can harm you, in fact, one might not even be able to detect such low voltages as the current needs to overcome the resistance of and go through.
