The angle at which the tires make contact with the road is a function of the car&#x2019;s suspension.&#xA0;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are generally three <strong>wheel alignment<\/strong> angles that determine the position of the wheels relative to each other and the car&#8217;s body.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Camber_Angle\"><\/span>Camber Angle<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The inward or outward angle of the wheel from the vertical with respect to the ground is called the camber angle.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Positive (+ve) camber: <\/strong>When the top of the wheel is laying outwards.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Negative (-ve) camber: <\/strong>When the top of the wheel is laying inwards.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Recommended camber settings for most road cars are between 0 and -1.0 degrees.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Toe_Angle\"><\/span>Toe Angle<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Toe angle is the angular position of the wheel when viewed from the top. In common words, the toe is basically the difference in the distances between the front and rear of the tires. It can be expressed in degrees, inches, or millimeters.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Neutral Toe: <\/strong>When the difference in the distances between the front and rear of the tires is zero, i.e. the distances are the same.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Toe-in:<\/strong> When the distance between the rear of the tires is greater than the front, or in other words, the wheels are pointing inwards.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Toe-out: <\/strong>When the distance between the rear of the tires is greater than that of the front, i.e. the wheels are pointing outwards.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Castor_Angle\"><\/span>Castor Angle&#xA0;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is the forward or backward inclination angle of the vertical axis of a vehicle&#x2019;s steered wheels when viewed from the side of the car.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Positive (+ve) caster:<\/strong> When the steering axis slants in front of the vertical axis toward the rear of the vehicle.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Negative (-ve) caster: <\/strong>When the steering axis slants in the back of the vertical axis toward the front of the vehicle.
