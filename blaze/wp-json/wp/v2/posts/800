These sorts of changes are generally done on the sides, bumper, or the lights which don&#x2019;t really create a major difference in a car&#x2019;s overall design. Though in some instances, a facelift changes the look of a car pretty drastically. For example the range rover velar. The new velar was given a sportier and curvy look over the sharper, more pronounced design that it had previously. Not only did it had small changes front and back, its minor alterations in the body made it look completely different than the previous model.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_50 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/what-does-facelift-mean-in-cars-automotive-facelift\/#Why_Do_Cars_Get_Facelifts\" title=\"Why Do Cars Get Facelifts?\">Why Do Cars Get Facelifts?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/what-does-facelift-mean-in-cars-automotive-facelift\/#What_Goes_In_An_Automotive_Facelift\" title=\"What Goes In An Automotive Facelift?\">What Goes In An Automotive Facelift?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/what-does-facelift-mean-in-cars-automotive-facelift\/#How_Often_Are_Cars_Facelifted\" title=\"How Often Are Cars Facelifted?&nbsp;\">How Often Are Cars Facelifted?&nbsp;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/what-does-facelift-mean-in-cars-automotive-facelift\/#Should_You_Wait_For_a_Facelift\" title=\"Should You Wait For a Facelift?\">Should You Wait For a Facelift?<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Do_Cars_Get_Facelifts\"><\/span>Why Do Cars Get Facelifts?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Change is as natural as being alive and the same is the case for the automotive world. The industry is constantly changing, evolving, and transforming for the better. Although, It&#x2019;s not every day that something new happens or manufacturers release new car models, in fact, the next generation of a given model doesn&#x2019;t come out for almost half a decade. That&#x2019;s quite a long period for the makers to think that the audience is not going to lose interest in what they created 5 or 8 years ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facelifts are a way to keep sales afloat. Automakers do not give generation upgrades every year but to make sure their product has steady demand in the market, it is important to always try and stay ahead of the curve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Goes_In_An_Automotive_Facelift\"><\/span>What Goes In An Automotive Facelift?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Facelifts cover a smorgasbord of changes in a car. The changes can range from minute tunings such as in the front and sides that are barely noticeable to more comprehensive makeovers like in the actual body of the car. Sometimes changes can be made to the inside of the cabin too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes made are usually small so the cost of such redesign isn&#x2019;t much and sometimes, a facelift may not affect the price at all. However, in some cases where the car undergoes a major overhaul, it could perhaps increase the price significantly. In the old day of car manufacturing when technology was evolving quite rapidly, facelifts usually were pretty considerable. Cars like the Model T look unrecognizable from each other when juxtaposed because of all the heavy facelifting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Often_Are_Cars_Facelifted\"><\/span>How Often Are Cars Facelifted?&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto Makers generally launch the next generation of their cars, every 6-8 years which is a complete redesign of the model &#8211; inside out. But during that long period, the car has on the market, makers need to make sure its youth doesn&#x2019;t fade away by reinventing and redesigning. A car is facelifted usually every 2-3 years before it is superseded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Should_You_Wait_For_a_Facelift\"><\/span>Should You Wait For a Facelift?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Waiting for a facelifted version of the car that you&#x2019;ve finally decided on buying can be either of two things &#8211; Mildly disappointing or wildly confusing. You see facelifts are small changes that can be either good, meh, or a complete fail. They are done in line with the current conception of an ideal design so most of the time they are quite appealing to the buyers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the facelifted version doesn&#x2019;t ring the same bell for you like the older one, you could possibly get your hands on a great deal. When the facelifted model arrives at the showroom, the previous model gets a clearance discount or some offer to wipe its stock, making the perfect opportunity for you to buy your dream car for a song.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A facelift is a surgical treatment that involves removing wrinkles, marks, and other visible signs of an aging skin to give a smoother, more youthful-looking appearance.
