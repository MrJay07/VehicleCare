It is common for an engine to run a few degrees hot while in use and in certain conditions, hot enough to harm other functioning components of the car. In such a case coolant absorbs the <a href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/car-engine-overheating\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">extra heat from the engine<\/a> and returns back to the radiator. While during winters, the coolant plays its part in the normal functioning of the engine in a different way. Extreme cold is detrimental to an engine and can cause it to freeze and even crack. Coolant prevents both overheating and freezing. With its antifreeze component, it does not let the engine freeze in sub-zero temperatures. In addition to regulating temperatures in the engine compartment, the coolant also deters corrosion build-up in certain parts of the engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_50 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#Types_of_Engine_Coolants\" title=\"Types of Engine Coolants\">Types of Engine Coolants<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#IAT-_Inorganic_Additive_Technology\" title=\"IAT- Inorganic Additive Technology\">IAT- Inorganic Additive Technology<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#OAT_%E2%80%93_Organic_Acid_Technology\" title=\"OAT &#x2013; Organic Acid Technology\">OAT &#x2013; Organic Acid Technology<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#HOAT_%E2%80%93_Hybrid_Organic_Acid_Technology\" title=\"HOAT &#x2013; Hybrid Organic Acid Technology\">HOAT &#x2013; Hybrid Organic Acid Technology<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#Phosphate-Free_HOAT\" title=\"Phosphate-Free HOAT\">Phosphate-Free HOAT<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#Phosphated_HOAT\" title=\"Phosphated HOAT\">Phosphated HOAT<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#Silicated_HOAT\" title=\"Silicated HOAT\">Silicated HOAT<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#What_Is_The_Best_Coolant_For_Your_Car\" title=\"What Is The Best Coolant For Your Car?\">What Is The Best Coolant For Your Car?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#Color_Doesn%E2%80%99t_Convey_Compatibility\" title=\"Color Doesn&#x2019;t Convey Compatibility\">Color Doesn&#x2019;t Convey Compatibility<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/types-of-engine-coolants\/#Is_It_Safe_To_Mix_Coolants\" title=\"Is It Safe To Mix Coolants\">Is It Safe To Mix Coolants<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_of_Engine_Coolants\"><\/span>Types of Engine Coolants<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coolants are available in a variety of colors with different specifications, but their basic composing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/materials-science\/coolant\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ingredients<\/a> include either ethylene glycol and propylene glycol in addition to water, and some protection additives.

IAT needs replacement approximately every two to three years or every 35,000 km. The IAT coolant contains silicates, which help in protecting your car&#x2019;s engine against the effects of corrosion. One cool thing about this coolant is that it is universally compatible meaning it can be used in just about any engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OAT_%E2%80%93_Organic_Acid_Technology\"><\/span>OAT &#x2013; Organic Acid Technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually available in orange, yellow, red, and purple color, OAT coolants are extremely different from IAT coolants.&nbsp; Unlike IAT coolants, they are made up of propylene glycol and have a life span of more than 4 years. It is one of the more efficient coolant fluids made using organic acids. It does not contain any phosphate or silicate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"HOAT_%E2%80%93_Hybrid_Organic_Acid_Technology\"><\/span>HOAT &#x2013; Hybrid Organic Acid Technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid organic acid technology is the main fluid in the family of <a href=\"https:\/\/knowhow.napaonline.com\/what-is-hoat-coolant-4-things-you-need-to-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HOAT<\/a> coolants. It is bifurcated into phosphate HOAT, phosphate-free HOAT, and silicated HOAT. This coolant was previously available only in one color- yellow tone. Now it is available in a whole spectrum of colors. You can find HOAT in orange, yellow, pink, and green.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HOAT coolant is a blend of the OAT and the IAT&nbsp; formula. It uses both organic and inorganic acids to protect your engine and deter corrosion. It replacing out at the same interval as OAT coolant: every five years of every 80,000 km. HOAT is generally used in all general motors, honda, and a few other vehicles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Phosphate-Free_HOAT\"><\/span>Phosphate-Free HOAT<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Phosphate-free HOAT is available in a beautiful turquoise blue color. Its NAP-free composition of ethylene glycol contains both organic and inorganic agents for corrosion inhibition. It does not contain phosphates, such as nitrate, nitrite, and borate. It is also sparing in the use of silicate in its formula.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phosphate-free HOAT is typically used in, Volvo, BWW, Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, Porsche, Mini, Volkswagen, and many other high-end cars. The phosphate-free formulation is made with the safety of your car&#x2019;s gaskets and seals in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Phosphated_HOAT\"><\/span>Phosphated HOAT<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Phosphated HOAT is usually available in either pink or blue color. This coolant makes use of carboxylates, phosphates, and organic acids rather than silicates to prevent the corrosion of the engine compartment. Due to radiator issues, Phosphated HOAT coolant is usually recommended for vehicles manufactured in Asia, like, Hyundai, KIA, Nissan, and Toyota.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Silicated_HOAT\"><\/span>Silicated HOAT<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This fluid comes in a recognizably striking purple hue and is used mostly in flagship engines such of a Mercedes-Benz, Rolls Royce, BMW, Bentley, Porsche, and Lamborghini. The Silicated HOAT uses organic acids and silicates for blocking corrosion build-up in your engine. It has a composition free of phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, borates, and imidazole.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coolant offers corrosion protection and effective cooling for five years or 240000 km.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_The_Best_Coolant_For_Your_Car\"><\/span>What Is The Best Coolant For Your Car?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the best engine coolant for your car depends on three factors namely the vehicle type, origin, and manufacturer. Typically one should get the coolant recommendation by the vehicle manufacturer for the specific model. Choosing the wrong coolant type can be deleterious to the engine and can lower its efficiency or worse cause it to fail.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note- if your car has been tweaked with new or different spares, this could vastly affect the type of coolant it would require. It is best to take expert assistance on this matter to ensure your car&#x2019;s safety and optimum performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Color Doesn&#x2019;t Convey Compatibility<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There might be a smorgasbord of coolants type with a spectrum of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.k2-global.com\/blog\/colour-of-the-engine-coolant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">colors<\/a> and though you might like to remember your car&#x2019;s coolant in the way IAT coolant is green and HOAT coolant is turquoise, Bear in mind that color isn&#x2019;t always an accurate measure for determining the right coolant type for your vehicle. There are specific brands designed for specific cars with geography and model also playing a role. It is advised to use color as a guide, but also always take the time to read the product label verifying the coolant&#x2019;s compatibility with your car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Is_It_Safe_To_Mix_Coolants\"><\/span>Is It Safe To Mix Coolants<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should not try to mix any kind of coolant on your own. The different colored anti-freezes may be made of the same ethylene glycol composition, but there are a number of additives that render the two incompatible. While it is said to have no problem mixing fluids of the same type but different colors, we would advise you to eschew any such practice if you replace the coolant yourself. To put it simply &#8211; The best-case scenario- you would weaken the corrosion inhibitors resulting in inefficient performance. Worst case scenario- you would end up destroying your engine.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are there different types of engine coolants? How many colors do they come in?
