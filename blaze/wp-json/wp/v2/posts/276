While that is true for the most part, certain electrical components in our cars are mechanically independent. And the failure of any of these electrical components can result in a poor driving experience. To identify and go about these common electrical faults, in this feature we&#x2019;ll discuss different electrical problems in cars, and their signs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

id=\"Starter_Motor_Problems\"><\/span>Starter Motor Problems<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The starter motor is an essential component required in the ignition process, it is responsible for providing the zap of current necessary for turning the engine over. The starter motor consists of a primary motor and solenoid. The primary motor is used to engage the crankshaft for turning the engine on, while the Solenoid is used for connecting the driving gear and closing the primary motor&#x2019;s electrical contacts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The main reason why your <a href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/symptoms-of-bad-starter\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">starter motor won&#x2019;t work<\/a> when the battery is not at fault is a burnt-out primary motor or solenoid. The primary motor usually burns out by shorting, while a broken solenoid is a rare scenario that happens when a solenoid coil burns out due to overvoltage. The excess voltage and force in the solenoid cause the plunger to close easily but due to an excessive holding current, the coil gradually overheats and goes up in smoke. Starter motor problems are extremely common and require replacement immediately, to limit the chances of any serious damage, we recommend not to make light of any signal indicating a starter motor problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_some_of_the_signs_to_look_for_in_faulty_starter_motor\"><\/span>Here are some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autoblog.com\/2016\/01\/12\/symptoms-of-a-bad-or-failing-starter\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signs<\/a> to look for in faulty starter motor-<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Car_not_starting_in_one_go\"><\/span>Car not starting in one go<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If it takes multiple tries to get your car started, its an indication of a faltering starting motor<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Clicking_Grinding_And_Whining_Noise\"><\/span>Clicking, Grinding, And Whining Noise<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The cause of these kinds of noises can be attributed to a problem with the flywheel and starter relay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Starter_Motor_not_turning_off\"><\/span>Starter Motor not turning off<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Under normal conditions, the power to the starter motor is cut off once the start button is released. If the starter motor stays on beyond this period, it is a sign of failure of the main contacts inside the solenoid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Starter_motor_soaked_in_oil\"><\/span>Starter motor soaked in oil<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Located at the bottom of the engine, starter motors are susceptible to getting soaked if there&#x2019;s an engine leak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Smoke_when_starting_the_engine\"><\/span>Smoke when starting the engine<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If you notice smoke coming out of the starter motor, it is an indication of a short circuit or the ignition switch going wrong. If you also smell burning, it is recommended to not drive your car any further and contact a mechanic immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Electrical_Short_Circuit\"><\/span>Electrical Short Circuit<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.firestonecompleteautocare.com\/blog\/batteries\/your-cars-electrical-system\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">electrical system<\/a> of a car can be divided into sensors and actuator circuits, Each of these circuits maintain proper functioning as long as the wiring stays intact. A short circuit in the electrical system of your car can manifest in a number of ways and due to that fact is one of the hardest electrical issues to diagnose and fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_some_signs_of_electrical_issues_in_your_car_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Here are some signs of electrical issues in your car &#8211;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Singed_wires\"><\/span>Singed wires<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Flickering failure of electrical components, slight burning smells are among the prime signals of a burned wire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Wires_or_harnesses_with_melted_insulation\"><\/span>Wires or harnesses with melted insulation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If you discover melted insulation early, you can be really lucky to avert a full short circuit. Sometimes the insulation is damaged, but not so bad that there are shorts in the harness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Blown_fuse\"><\/span>Blown fuse<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">A blown fuse is one of the most helpful signs of an electrical problem in a car. If there&#x2019;s an issue with the electrical fuse in your car, the car&#x2019;s normal functioning will not be affected rather the interior lights, backup lights radio, climate control features will cease to function. Only in rare cases, though, will a blown fuse would cause your car to not start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Burned_fusible_link\"><\/span>Burned fusible link<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The fusible link is an in-line fuse on the positive terminal of the battery. To check for a burned or blown fusible link, one can test the ohmmeter for high resistance. If the link is fine, the ohmmeter will read the same resistance as the test leads are touched together or a will read a low resistance, generally lower than 0.2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Open_circuit\"><\/span>Open circuit<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">It is the simplest electrical problem to occur in a car and be identified, that is for the circuit to be &#x201C;open.&#x201D; The switch going off its position and rendering an open circuit is generally caused by a blown fuse, so, if you have identified an issue with the fuse, it is quite likely for you to find the circuit to be open as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Faulty_Spark_plugs\"><\/span>Faulty Spark plugs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Spark plugs are designed to supply the zap of current necessary to ignites the fuel mixture, which makes the engine produce power. They are essential for optimum performance and should be cleaned carefully without damaging the electrodes. Sparks plugs, if failing, directly affect the performance of the engine. A <a href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/symptoms-bad-spark-plugs\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">bad spark plug<\/a> is one that gets enveloped and fouled with substances like oil, fuel, and carbon. Driving with bad spark plugs can wreak havoc on your engine and make your car more vulnerable to breakdowns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_some_of_the_early_signs_to_look_for_in_bad_spark_plugs\"><\/span>Here are some of the early signs to look for in bad spark plugs-<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reduced_mileage\"><\/span>Reduced mileage<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If you experience a sudden drop in your fuel mileage and find yourself more on the gas station than on the road, one possible cause could be bad spark plugs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Slow_Acceleration\"><\/span>Slow Acceleration<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">A sluggish acceleration can be attributed to dirty spark plugs. If you are not able to get the pick-up speed you used to, then it might help to check and clean your spark plugs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Engine_misfires\"><\/span>Engine misfires<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Engine misfiring is due to an interruption in the ignition process which can be ascribed to failing spark plugs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Noise_while_idling\"><\/span>Noise while idling<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">This is one of the most telltale signs of spark plug problems. Normally your car should sound calm and quiet while waiting in the traffic but if the spark plugs have gone bad, you could experience vibrations and disquieting noise when idling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Dead_Car_Battery\"><\/span>Dead Car Battery<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Here&#x2019;s the most common of them all- A <a href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/bad-car-battery-signs\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">dead car battery<\/a> is the most routinely experienced electrical problem by everyone. Since all car batteries have a putative lifespan of about 5 years, most of us are generally well equipped to replace the battery and pay heed to battery maintenance. However, the life of a battery is influenced by a myriad of factors like hot\/cold weather, short trips, moisture\/corrosion, driving habits, etc. Due to these countless, altering effects, it becomes exceedingly difficult to determine when exactly your car battery is going to leave you stranded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_some_of_the_early_signs_to_look_for_in_a_failing_car_battery\"><\/span>Here are some of the early signs to look for in a failing car battery-<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Battery_connectors_are_corroded\"><\/span>Battery connectors are corroded<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Corroded battery connectors are the most apparent signs of a dying battery. Simply look for white ashy substances on your battery to know if the connectors are corroded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Dim_Lights\"><\/span>Dim Lights<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If one night, you notice your headlights not glowing as bright as they used to, that could mean, your car battery is about to die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Rotten-smelling_car_battery\"><\/span>Rotten-smelling car battery<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If the battery is internally damaged and has a gas leak, your car can smell like rotten eggs under the hood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Car_battery_shape_has_changed\"><\/span>Car battery shape has changed<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">A change in shape is mostly caused by hot weather conditions. If your car battery&#x2019;s perfect rectangular shape has been disfigured, chances are, it isn&#x2019;t performing well and needs immediate replacement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bad_Alternator\"><\/span>Bad Alternator<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Another crucial electrical component in a vehicle is the alternator, it works to turn mechanical energy into electrical energy, keeping all the other electrical parts alive when the battery turns off, like headlights, power steering, wipers, and your lit-up dashboard. Though the alternator has a long life and can even function throughout the lifetime of your car, its actual run depends on a number of factors like wire quality, heat, exposure to water, etc. Without a fully functioning alternator, your car will not haul more than a few meters and all the other electrical parts will also begin to fail, making it extremely important to determine the early signs that can help you stave off heavy expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_some_of_the_signs_to_look_for_in_faulty_alternator\"><\/span>Here are some of the signs to look for in faulty alternator-<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Overly_bright_lights\"><\/span>Overly bright lights<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Though dim lights can be a sign of a failing battery, overly bright lights cannot be mistaken for anything other than your alternator malfunctioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Malfunctioning_car_accessories\"><\/span>Malfunctioning car accessories<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If you find yourself struggling to use the infotainment system or turn the ac on while driving, it could possibly because of some issue in the alternator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Car_Stalls_after_few_minutes_of_starting\"><\/span>Car Stalls after few minutes of starting<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The alternator supplies current to the spark plugs helping it to turn the engine on. When the alternator is failing, it might not be able to provide enough power in the spark plugs causing small hiccups when you try to start your ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Battery_Warning_light\"><\/span>Battery Warning light<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The check battery light on your dashboard is meant to indicate a problem within the wider electrical system rather than just the battery. This warning light could be a sign of a problem that your car has detected in the alternator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Failing_ECU_Engine_Control_Unit\"><\/span>Failing ECU Engine Control Unit<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Lastly, let&#x2019;s dive into the rarest of electrical problems with a car. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electronic_control_unit\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engine control unit<\/a>, also known as the engine control module, is responsible for controlling a series of actuators on the combustion engine to ensure its optimal performance. A damaged engine control unit could impair the effective operation of your vehicle and limit your safety on the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_some_of_the_signs_to_look_for_in_a_faltering_Engine_Control_Unit_ECU\"><\/span>Here are some of the signs to look for in a faltering Engine Control Unit (ECU)-<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Check_Engine_Light_stays_on\"><\/span>Check Engine Light stays on<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">The easiest way to detect ECU problems is to check if the check engine light is illuminated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Overheating_Engine\"><\/span>Overheating Engine<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">If your car is heating too much, even when not driving in hot weather conditions, it could be a sign of a problem with the engine control unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Engine_turns_off_for_no_reason\"><\/span>Engine turns off for no reason<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Another indicator of ECU malfunctions is the engine halting or turning off suddenly for no apparent reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\">Hope you found this handy list of electrical problems informational.
