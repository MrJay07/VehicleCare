The Regional Transport Office (RTO) where the vehicle was first registered issues NOCs. A NOC assures that a vehicle&#8217;s registration is free of its original jurisdiction and can be registered at any RTO in the country. The NOC also serves as confirmation of payment of all debts, including taxes, Challans, and other responsibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When moving from one state to another, obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the RTO is a vital step that many vehicle owners ignore. Of course, if you don&#8217;t plan to stay in the new place for long, you won&#8217;t need this paperwork, but if you do, you&#8217;ll need to transfer your vehicle&#8217;s registration from one state to another. In general, if you want to operate your car in a new state or union territory for less than three months, you do not need to transfer the vehicle&#8217;s registration to the new RTO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan to move to a new state or UT for more than a year, the law requires you to update the vehicle&#8217;s registration to the new RTO. While many states do not strictly enforce this law, it is beneficial to observe it to avoid additional headaches when filing insurance claims, etc. A key item to remember is that you must receive a NOC from the original RTO before applying for registration in a new state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A No Objection Certificate (NOC) is a legal document issued by the previous RTO that permits the vehicle to be re-registered at the new transport office. It should be mentioned that submitting NOC is required while filing for car re-registration. The NOC certifies that the vehicle&#8217;s owner is not obliged to pay any challans or other fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_50 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#Importance_of_Obtaining_a_NOC\" title=\"Importance of Obtaining a NOC\">Importance of Obtaining a NOC<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#Who_Should_Apply_for_a_NOC\" title=\"Who Should Apply for a NOC?\">Who Should Apply for a NOC?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#How_to_get_NOC_for_a_bike\" title=\"How to get NOC for a bike?\">How to get NOC for a bike?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#How_to_get_NOC_for_a_bike_online\" title=\"How to get NOC for a bike online?\">How to get NOC for a bike online?<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-2'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#Bank_NOC_for_bike\" title=\"Bank NOC for bike\">Bank NOC for bike<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#RTO_NOC_for_bike\" title=\"RTO NOC for bike\">RTO NOC for bike<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#How_to_get_NOC_from_RTO_online\" title=\"How to get NOC from RTO online?\">How to get NOC from RTO online?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#How_to_get_NOC_for_a_car\" title=\"How to get NOC for a car?\">How to get NOC for a car?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#Things_to_consider_while_getting_a_car_NOC\" title=\"Things to consider while getting a car NOC\">Things to consider while getting a car NOC<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#Documents_Required_to_get_NOC_for_a_car\" title=\"Documents Required to get NOC for a car\">Documents Required to get NOC for a car<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-11\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/how-to-get-noc-from-rto\/#Validity_of_NOC\" title=\"Validity of NOC\">Validity of NOC<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Importance_of_Obtaining_a_NOC\"><\/span><b>Importance of Obtaining a NOC<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NOC is a required document that must be filed to the RTO if you wish to sell your car or if you move within or outside of the state. The NOC certifies that you owe no obligations to the agencies and that you have paid all relevant fees and penalties or, in the case of a bank loan, repaid the loan.

It will be given to its buyer for submission in the new state&#8217;s RTO once it has been obtained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application initiation is different in the case of a vehicle owner&#8217;s death and the legal successor residing in the jurisdiction of an RTO other than the RTO of the vehicle&#8217;s registration.
