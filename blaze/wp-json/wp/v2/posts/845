Even among the cars available from Kia, Seltos has been ahead of SONET and carnival by huge margins. So it only makes sense for Kia to expand on this hovering opportunity to boost its sale even further and give the audiences more of what they want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CSoadPKh2So\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CSoadPKh2So\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Instagram post teasing the X line doesn&#x2019;t give much away in terms of the design. The trailer shows a dark shadow of the chassis that from the looks of it can be expected to be a 7 seater version. Later with an illuminated front, the headlights unveil little difference over the normal Seltos. Here we can see a fancier front splitter that composes contrasting shades to the original color of the vehicle and a meaner front grill with unique Seltos badging running across the top-down of the bonnet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What To Expect<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-846\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-768x509.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-850x563.jpg 850w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-24x16.jpg 24w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-36x24.jpg 36w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed-48x32.jpg 48w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/20200212125038_Seltos-X-Line-02-compressed.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the official announcement, there have been a few pictures leaked online of the X line which though not confirming anything, do tell a great deal about what should be expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pictures reveal the new Seltos to be a darker shade of gray with bits of orange here and there. The gray color looks something along the lines of a metal nail that had been scurried with graphite and then wiped off &#8211; something we did in school. It is quite an unseen paint configuration that will surely make this version stand out from the rest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures also reveal the car sporting alloy wheels and new side skirt cuts embossed with orange X line badging. As unveiled in the promo the car does sport a Seltos badging on the bonnet. How the car might look inside cannot be definitively told on because of the dark mirrorshades which probably will be dropped for the on-road version.&#xA0;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the engine configuration, the new Seltos would probably have the same engine as the normal seltos. It will likely come with a 1.5-liter diesel engine and a 1.4-liter turbo-petrol engine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Options on the transmission would include a six-speed manual gearbox, a six-speed automatic, and a seven-speed DCT gearbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems unlikely that Kia will offer an upgrade or a tuned version of such as Hyundai also seemed to have kept the changes limited onto the exterior of the i20.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In close lockstep with parent brand Hyundai, Kia seeks to aim for a new line of the upper-end models for its own bestseller vehicle &#8211; The Seltos.&nbsp; Kia recently revealed the news of its&#46;&#46;&#46;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":200024,"featured_media":848,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[18],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/845"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/200024"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=845"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/845\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":852,"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/845\/revisions\/852"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/848"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=845"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=845"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=845"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
