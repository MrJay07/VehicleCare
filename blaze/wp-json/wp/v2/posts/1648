This new technology takes its name from the kind of work it allows the driver to do. Head up display, popularly known as HUD was initially used in military aviation but it has gradually shifted to automobiles, as a safety feature. HUD is named after a pilot who used to keep his head positioned upwards and forward instead of inclining at an angle to view lower instruments.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Components_of_a_Head-Up_Display\"><\/span><strong>Components of a Head-Up Display<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A typical HUD consists of three main components: a projector, combiner, and a video generation computer. It uses an optical collimator setup which consists of a convex lens and a cathode ray tube, that diverges the ray to a point where it is collimated, to display an image on a transparent screen. The combiner is a flat glass which is located in front of the driver. This glass redirects the rays in such a form that infinity images are formed. Combiners have a special sort of coating that reflects the monochromatic light that is projected on it from the projector unit. The video generation computer acts as an interface between the head-up display and the data that is displayed and generates the images on the transparent display.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Working_of_Head-Up_Display\"><\/span><strong>Working of Head-Up Display<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A Head-Up Display uses a Bluetooth connection. It connects with the phone and gets all the updates like vehicle speed, location, it interacts with google maps and helps in navigation directions, traffic speeds, and local speed limit. The information is then viewed on the display angled at the optimal vision. Alternatively, it can also connect directly to the car via a USB cable. For models which have an in-built feature of the HUD display also project information like engine temperature, fuel mileage, and RPM.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Installation_of_Head-Up_Display\"><\/span><strong>Installation of Head-Up Display<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Installation of a HUD is as easy as possible. The base assembly is simply stuck on the dashboard and the power cable is connected to the accessory port. The screen assembly can easily be removed when not in use. The display is paired to the mobile device via Bluetooth and all the necessary changes on the display can be made. This customization includes the positioning of the widgets, the requirement of the widgets, their sizes, and all other information and modifications.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_of_Head-Up_Display\"><\/span><strong>Types of Head-Up Display<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Based on generations of a Head-Up Display, we have 4 types of HUD: first, second, third, and fourth generation. The first-generation HUD uses a cathode ray tube to generate images on a phosphor screen. The second generation of HUD uses a solid-state light source such as a LED, which requires an LCD screen to project images. The third generation of HUD includes optical waveguides that project images on a projection system. Lastly, the fourth generation of HUD uses a scanning laser that displays images on a transparent screen. Presently the fourth generation HUDs are in use.<\/p>\n<p>Differentiating them on the techniques, a HUD system is mainly of two types, projection-based, and reflection-based. The projection-based HUD system makes use of LED lights or lasers and projects the information. The final image formed through this system is very clear but the system is expensive overall and more complicated. On the other hand, a reflection-based&#xA0; HUD system makes use of a digital display that projects images on the specifically designed glass screen, for this purpose. The image formed through this display is not very clear but the main advantage of this system lies in the fact that it is cheap and can be used as a plug and play solution in most car models.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Advantages_of_HUD\"><\/span><strong>Advantages of HUD<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The main advantage of a head-up display is that it simplifies the driving experience by amplifying the driving information so that the driver can maintain a better focus on the road ahead. As its name suggests, the head-up display helps the driver keep the eyes on the road and allows to keep the head up all the time. Everything the driver needs to know about while driving is projected on a single screen in the sight of the driver.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, the head-up display reduces the fatigue and stress of the driver by posing a better focus on the road. It reduces the risk of accidents or any casualties on the road since the distractions are less and immediate action can be taken in case of road dangers.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most admiring features of a Head-Up Display is that it can connect with external cameras with a built-in video input port. With this feature, we can even access the night vision camera and project its images directly on the HUD.<\/p>\n<p>Another advantage of the HUD is that it can connect with the phone and project all the notifications and OBDII data directly from the vehicle.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Disadvantages_of_Head-Up_Display\"><\/span><strong>Disadvantages of Head-Up Display<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>According to the current HUD technology, more development is required in this field. Not every model of a car has basic specifications that can implement the HUD technology. A Head-Up Display is expensive, thus it adds up to the cost of the vehicle. Sometimes, it becomes a distraction to the driver rather than a convenience. Some drivers do not prefer a head-up display since they are conventional to driving and have a practice of concentrating on the display as well as the road at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, it also requires a data connection of the phone. The base of the display cannot be repositioned easily if it is not placed in the correct position.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Best_Head-Up_Displays\"><\/span><strong>Best Head-Up Displays<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hudway_Drive\"><\/span><strong>Hudway Drive<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>One of the finest Head-Up Displays is the Hudway Drive.
