This allows them to accumulate dust and dirt.

The AC vents may contain pollens, mold, mildew, spores, and other bacteria that can lead to a number of health problems, outside of the adverse effects it can have on an allergic person. Cleaning AC ducts thoroughly in times like these can especially be salutary as airborne particles migrating from other countries are of huge concern.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Removes_Bad_Odor\"><\/span><strong>Removes Bad Odor<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your car AC has a smell of its own. When turned on the AC suffuses the air inside with a scent that is not particularly fragrant but has a distinctly cool connotation. If your car AC is beginning is to fail or has a clogged duct, the odors it will emit will not be pleasant. With an accumulation of dust and dirt of months, it can produce a sharp musty smell and even lead to the AC blowing hot air. To avoid this unpleasant situation, you can clean the air ducts regularly and prevent the growth of smelly bacteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Improves_Airflow\"><\/span><strong>Improves Airflow<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise that a heavy build-up of dirt and grime will fetter the proper flow of air inside the air conditioning system. It is due to this reason that you need to get an AC service along with your regularly scheduled car service. However, there are a number of other factors that may ramp-up or even cause to clog your car AC. Such factors may include debris coming in from the front, too frequently lowered windows, a windy day, etc. Making sure that the AC system is unclogged and unfettered can help you greatly in obtaining the best performance and cooling out of your AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_Are_The_3_Easy_Ways_To_Clean_AC_Vents_At_Home\"><\/span><strong>Here Are The 3 Easy Ways To Clean AC Vents At Home<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mold Growth Prevention Method<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Items required- None<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brush Off Dust-<\/strong>&nbsp;Do not let any kind of dust accumulate on the vent.
