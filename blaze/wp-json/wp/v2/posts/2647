Almost every other automobile on the road is an SUV or MUV. While many people are unaware of the differences between SUVs and MUVs, each has a distinct performance and price. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the amount of automobiles available in the SUV market that resemble the well-known SUV, customers are likely spoilt for choice right now. Because of the severe rivalry, brands are launching SUVs in all niches to meet the market demand for SUVs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As a result, while SUVs are at the top of the food chain, automakers are experimenting with size, features, and total engine capabilities to bring SUV comfort and power to a lower price point. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUVs are similar to trucks not just in terms of construction,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but also in terms of rugged characteristics and engine power. SUVs have a higher body than MUVs, which are just larger sedans with more passenger capacity than regular vehicles. SUVs are divided into subcategories. The other major variations between the two cars reflect this crucial difference in the appearance and genealogy of the two automobiles.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_50 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#SUV_Vs_MUV_Vs_XUV\" title=\"SUV Vs MUV Vs XUV\">SUV Vs MUV Vs XUV<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#SUV_Vs_MUV_Cars\" title=\"SUV Vs MUV Cars\">SUV Vs MUV Cars<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-2'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#What_are_SUV_Cars\" title=\"What are SUV Cars?\">What are SUV Cars?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#What_are_MUV_Cars\" title=\"What are MUV Cars?\">What are MUV Cars?<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#Difference_between_SUV_and_MUV\" title=\"Difference between SUV and MUV\">Difference between SUV and MUV<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#Things_to_consider_before_buying_an_SUV_or_a_MUV\" title=\"Things to consider before buying an SUV or a MUV\">Things to consider before buying an SUV or a MUV<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-2'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#Off-road_travels\" title=\"Off-road travels\">Off-road travels<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#Type_of_vehicle\" title=\"Type of vehicle\">Type of vehicle<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#Mileage\" title=\"Mileage\">Mileage<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#Price\" title=\"Price\">Price<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-1'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-11\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/suv-vs-muv\/#SUV_Vs_MUV_Which_is_Better\" title=\"SUV Vs MUV: Which is Better?\">SUV Vs MUV: Which is Better?<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SUV_Vs_MUV_Vs_XUV\"><\/span><b>SUV Vs MUV Vs XUV<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these words are used by different automobile vendors around the world to describe the car type based on its appearance and primary use. SUV is the most well-known term used by practically all major automobile manufacturers to describe large vehicles with seating capacity of 5 or 7 people and off-roading capability. SUVs are larger than traditional family vehicles. MUVs and XUVs, on the other hand, are classified as SUVs, although different manufacturers have given their somewhat distinct automobiles with unique features the names MUVs and XUVs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MUVs are a huge, car-like SUV with no off-roading capability because they are designed to be used as a city waggon. XUV, on the other hand, is a specific type of vehicle given the term by specific firms in India, such as TATA and Mahindra. The term XUV is more particularly applied to hybrid vehicles that have a distinct design and architecture that does not fit into any of the traditional design categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">XUV is the abbreviation for Crossover Utility Vehicle. It&#8217;s essentially a hybrid vehicle that combines elements from both MUVs and SUVs. Few Indian automakers, such as TATA and Mahindra, refer to their vehicles as XUV. These vehicles have unique architecture and a mix of athletic and urban elements. XUVs can be off-road capable while also being fuel efficient and suitable for urban use. In some circumstances, a XUV can be AWD, 4WD, RWD, or even FWD.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SUV_Vs_MUV_Cars\"><\/span><b>SUV Vs MUV Cars<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we distinguish between SUV and MUV cars, it is very important to understand what SUVs and MUVs really mean. Let&#8217;s have a look at that!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_SUV_Cars\"><\/span><b>What are SUV Cars?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUV is an American phrase that refers to vehicles with a lot of passenger and cargo room with the ability to go off-road across rugged terrain. The phrase is currently used to describe a considerably broader range of automobiles. Some, like the Ford EcoSport, are quite compact. The Range Rover, for example, is a huge luxury vehicle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some even drive sports cars, such as the Porsche Cayenne. The majority are ideal family vehicles. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within that broad range, there are a few characteristics that unite SUVs and distinguish them from other automobiles. They all have suspension that lifts them off the ground more than a hatchback, and many have comparatively tall bodywork and four-wheel drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_MUV_Cars\"><\/span><b>What are MUV Cars?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MUVs, on the other hand, are a scaled-down variant of SUVs. Engine power, interior capacity, and, most importantly, pricing are all lower than SUVs, but higher than hatchbacks and even sedans. MUVs are the perfect alternative for people who want to explore the SUV category but can&#8217;t afford the higher price tags associated with SUVs. The FWD operating system is implemented on MUVs.&#xA0;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the perfect choice for those who want to have a relaxing drive with their family and friends in a roomy cabinet. MUVs, on the other hand, are less efficient than SUVs when it comes to exploring off-road tracks. Though they provide adequate performance in a rough environment, it is hardly what you would expect from an SUV.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MUVs have provided purchasers with an interesting SUV option. Buyers have an affordable option in the SUV category to ensure that budget constraints do not prevent them from owning an SUV car. They are cheaper than SUVs and have higher fuel efficiency than SUVs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Difference_between_SUV_and_MUV\"><\/span><b>Difference between SUV and MUV<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fundamental distinction between MUV and SUV is that MUV is derived from the well-known line of passenger minivans, whilst SUV is an improvement on a truck&#8217;s rugged design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s have a look at some other distinctive differences between SUVs and MUVs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Multi-Utility Vehicle is a large vehicle that can transport at least 5-6 passengers. A Sports Utility Vehicle, on the other hand, is a lightweight vehicle that is effectively built as an adventure vehicle capable of navigating difficult outdoor terrain.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fundamental difference between a MUV and an SUV is that the former is based on a minivan design, while the latter is based on a truck design. The former resembles a larger sedan with more passenger capacity, whereas the latter represents adventure vehicles that are powerful and durable, similar to trucks.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two words have different abbreviations. While MUV stands for Multi-Utility Vehicle, SUV is a typical abbreviation for Sports Utility Vehicle.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUVs are off-road vehicles designed for tough terrain and frequent use. MUVs are inappropriate for such terrains.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A MUV is typically driven by a front-wheel-drive system. This eliminates the need for a driveshaft, allowing for more inside space. SUVs are often equipped with either rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) systems.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUVs are often more expensive than MUVs. MUVs are more affordable on the market, and their maintenance costs are also cheaper.&#xA0;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUV engines are more powerful than MUV engines. When compared to an SUV engine, the strength of a MUV engine is weaker.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to fuel efficiency, the two types of automobiles are similarly at odds. MUVs are regarded for being more cost-effective and fuel-efficient, but SUVs are noted for having poorer mileage and higher fuel costs.&#xA0;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Things_to_consider_before_buying_an_SUV_or_a_MUV\"><\/span><b>Things to consider before buying an SUV or a MUV<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few things you need to keep in mind before you decide to buy a SUV or a MUV:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Off-road_travels\"><\/span><b>Off-road travels<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most circumstances, this alone will assist you in making a selection. SUVs are distinguished from other vehicles by their superior off-road capability. I can&#8217;t stress this enough. Have you ever seen those advertisements when the SUV crosses a tiny river and climbs a sloping hill? Yes, this is exactly what they were made for. Go for it if you and your friends and family are always up for an adventure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MUVs, on the other hand, lack that capability off-road. They, like SUVs, have a large passenger and cargo capacity and are suitable for standard roads and highways. On roads with potholes, MUVs provide the same level of comfort that a sedan would. They have higher ground clearance than sedans, although they are not recommended for rough terrain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Type_of_vehicle\"><\/span><b>Type of vehicle<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4WD or AWD (4 Wheel Drive OR All Wheel Drive) systems are available on SUVs. These drivetrains enable SUVs to gain a lot of traction, control, and grip on slippery surfaces. These systems add to the weight of these vehicles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, MUVs use RWD (Rear Wheel Drive) systems, in which the engine&#8217;s power is only sent to the rear wheels. This is the most prevalent drive system, and it can be found in practically all modern sedans and hatchbacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mileage\"><\/span><b>Mileage<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUVs are equipped with large and powerful engines. That&#8217;s understandable considering the drive system, many passengers, and bags. They also require more torque to traverse difficult terrain. Engines with more torque use more fuel. As a result, SUVs are significantly less fuel efficient!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MUVs are sedan-style cars built to transport extra cargo and people rather than climb slopes and terrains. As a result, MUVs are marginally more fuel efficient than SUVs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Price\"><\/span><b>Price<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complex drive systems, large engines, high-grip tyres, and improved suspensions are what make SUVs so athletic and powerful. However, the cooler it sounds, the more expensive it becomes. This is why an SUV is so costly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MUVs are less expensive than SUVs and only slightly more expensive than sedans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SUV_Vs_MUV_Which_is_Better\"><\/span><b>SUV Vs MUV: Which is Better?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MUVs and SUVs are two types of large vehicles that are meant to make travel more comfortable. These cars are popular because of their large interiors and various passenger capacities. Despite the obvious distinctions between the two, there may be an overlook in their assessments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Multi-Utility Vehicle resembles a minivan in appearance. Apart from the lower cost of the vehicle, these vehicles also have exceptional mileage, making them a popular choice among most families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Sports Utility Vehicle, on the other hand, is built utilizing truck plans. It has a solid, durable construction and is built on an elevated platform. These cars are great for chasing the spirit of adventure in naturally undulating terrains, despite their high cost. However, these automobiles are not very cost effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision between the two will be based on various personal factors, the most important of which is the vehicle&#8217;s function. MUVs are the better option if you want a roomy yet beautiful station waggon, while SUVs may be a better fit if you seek adventure.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SUVs have successfully piqued the curiosity of Indian car customers.
