In India, where the population density is high, especially when it comes to cities, accidents causing dents, scratches, and removal of paint are very common. Teflon is known to provide an additional layer of protection to the paint, which ensures the longevity of the paint job and corrosion and also provides a glossy, shiny, and smooth look to the car. Teflon, also known as Polytetrafluoroethylene, is a synthesized fluoropolymer.

The chemical polymer is applied on the exterior surface of the car to protect the paint from external harm. It has the property of blending with the car paint and creating an additional hydrophobic layer of protection for your paint. Because of this property, ceramic coating is considered a permanent coating that can keep your car&#x2019;s paint untouched from outside damage. Sometimes called nano-ceramic coating, ceramic coating act as a long-term exterior paint protectant. Applied in liquid form, it forms a hard glass-like layer on top of the paint. The ceramic coating is generally composed of silicon dioxide (some also use titanium dioxide) which is sourced from naturally occurring materials like quartz and sand. Due to its chemical properties, it does not easily break down in extreme atmospheric conditions like summer or rain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Procedure_to_Apply_Ceramic_Coating\"><\/span><b>Procedure to Apply Ceramic Coating:<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wash your car properly.
