This sort of claim settlement places all the responsibility on the insured, from arranging payments, filing claims, to liaising with the workshop and getting approvals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Features_Of_Reimbursement_Claims\"><\/span>Features Of Reimbursement Claims<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Payment initially is made by the insured themselves.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Insured has to deal with the workshop&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Costs involved need to be arranged by the insured in the given time period.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reimbursement will take time to be processed&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>More paperwork than cashless claims&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Process_Of_Reimbursement_Claims\"><\/span>Process Of Reimbursement Claims&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For getting a reimbursement claim, firstly the insured needs to inform the insurance company through mail or post, 24-48 (depending on the insurance company) hours prior to sending the car for repair. The claim will be assessed for authenticity and payments to the insured will only be made after the claim has been approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cashless_Claims\"><\/span>Cashless Claims&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cashless claim is a method of settlement that is most convenient to the insured. In this way of reimbursement, the insured need to not pay anything from their side, outside a nominal file charge. The responsibility of paying the garage lies with the insurance company which needs to be impaneled with the same.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Features_Of_Cashless_Insurance_Claims\"><\/span>Features Of Cashless Insurance Claims&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No payment from the insured&#8217;s side<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Insurer deals directly with the garage<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No need to arrange funds on a short notice<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No waiting period of reimbursement&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No huge paperwork.

Once the claim has been raised, the insurance company will send one of their surveyors agents to assess the damages on the vehicle and ascertain the authenticity of the claim made. Then, after the surveyor rules the claim to be true and genuine and the claim amount is within the IDV of the insured property, the claim will be approved.&nbsp; Here, the insurance company will pay the entire sum of repair cost on the vehicle to the said garage without any involvement of the insured.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Which_Is_Better\"><\/span>Which Is Better?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under any type of insurance, generally speaking, a cashless claim is much better and preferred mode of settlement by consumers. Simply delegating the responsibility to the insurance company for taking the hassles on is far more convenient than having to pay it from your own side, which especially becomes a fuss when you are in the throes of a crisis situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where a reimbursement claim lays all the burden of paying out in tandem with the endless paperwork that needs to be filled to get the approval and compensation, cashless claim really works best in a situation of emergency as it does not bring any hassle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Choosing_VehicleCare_For_Your_Cashless_Claims\"><\/span>Choosing VehicleCare For Your Cashless Claims&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For your cashless procedure to go smoothly without any hiccups, there are various aspects of your insurance policy that need to be kept in mind.
