your blood pumping when you drive is a vehicle that looks great. The kind of car, truck, or SUV you choose says a lot about who you are as a person. But it&#x2019;s not just about style&#x2014;it&#x2019;s also about performance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, if I had to make one choice between style and performance, I&#x2019;d go with a stylish vehicle that performs well over an average-looking but high-performing car every time. So today, we want to talk hatchbacks vs sedans because they represent two different types of vehicles when it comes to style and performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Difference_between_Hatchback_and_Sedan\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difference between Hatchback and Sedan<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When most people think of a car, they imagine a sedan. They&#x2019;re ubiquitous on city streets and country roads alike, with their boxy shape and long wheelbase. So when you think of buying a new car, do you automatically consider sedans? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about hatchbacks? They&#x2019;re different enough that both cars have unique advantages for their owners. Let&#x2019;s break down what makes them different to help you decide which type of vehicle might be right for your situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hatchback_cars_vs_Sedan\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hatchback cars vs Sedan<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hatchback car and a sedan both have four wheels, but that&#x2019;s where their similarities end. A hatchback is characterized by its opening or tailgate and roomy cargo capacity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you need more room than a sedan, but don&#x2019;t want to pay for an SUV, a hatch may be your ideal choice. Likewise, if you don&#x2019;t like stepping up into an SUV (and most people don&#x2019;t),<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a hatchback could be your best bet. It depends on what you need and which design makes you happiest! Read on to discover more about these two different vehicle designs!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Learn how to choose between these two different types of cars with help from an automotive technician in How-To: Choose Between Hatchbacks vs Sedans<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Sedan_or_Hatchback_which_is_better\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sedan or Hatchback which is better<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The front of a car can be a dangerous place. Cars are designed to protect you from objects that hit you in a specific area, which means if you&#x2019;re not wearing a seatbelt or your airbag fails to deploy, your head could take on an enormous amount of force upon impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To avoid getting seriously injured in an accident, it&#x2019;s always important to wear your seatbelt and make sure it&#x2019;s buckled when there&#x2019;s no one else in the car. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The type of vehicle also matters&#x2014;sedans generally have larger crumple zones than hatchbacks and minivans; because of their smaller size and profile, most people consider them safer than many other vehicle types.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hatchback_vs_Sedan_safety\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hatchback vs Sedan safety<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hatchbacks and sedans are popular cars for commuters in Minneapolis, with each type of vehicle having its own advantages. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The safety of these vehicles can differ depending on size and model, though. If you&#8217;re wondering which type of car is right for you, read on to learn about some differences between sedans and hatchbacks in terms of crash tests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Safety ratings come from NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) crash test data for 2015 models as reported by Edmunds and refer to five-star overall ratings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Should_I_go_for_a_Sedan_or_Hatchback\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should I go for a Sedan or Hatchback?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many different vehicles to choose from, it&#x2019;s tough to figure out which one will be best for you. Choosing a car can be confusing;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you need to take into account size, horsepower, and MPG. You also have to consider if you&#x2019;re willing to make an investment in a hybrid vehicle or stick with a more traditional gas-powered car. If you want something that&#x2019;s fuel-efficient and on-trend, <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">then a sedan could be right for you. Hatchbacks are easy and practical since they offer much of what sedans do but cost less and provide more cargo space&#x2014;making them perfect for people who love driving around town in style!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_do_people_prefer_Hatchbacks_over_Sedans\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do people prefer Hatchbacks over Sedans?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you look at hatchbacks and sedans, it&#x2019;s easy to assume that people would go for a sedan, but that&#x2019;s not always the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In fact, some people actually prefer hatchbacks. Both cars have their pros and cons, but these are a few of them: Hatchbacks Sedans tend to have more headroom They tend to be more expensive Cheaper gas bills<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sometimes they have better storage Larger trunk Smaller trunk Better fuel economy Higher chance of theft when left in public view Both are great options for different situations&#x2014;there really isn&#x2019;t a clear-cut winner here.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Is_the_Hatchback_more_stable_than_a_Sedan\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the Hatchback more stable than a Sedan?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re looking to buy a new vehicle, it can be hard to decide between a sedan and a hatchback. What&#8217;s more important? Stability or style, function or fashion?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are lots of factors that go into determining which one is best for you. To help you get started, here are four key things to consider when choosing between sedans and hatchbacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Is_a_Hatchback_a_good_family_car\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is a Hatchback a good family car?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hatchback can fit a lot of people, making it perfect for families. It also has a nice amount of storage room if you need to fit in some luggage and is easy to maneuver, making it easier for kids to get in and out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no trunk space, however, your family won&#x2019;t be able to bring home as many groceries or other items from trips out. Not all vehicles are created equal when it comes to cargo capacity&#x2014;so think about what you&#x2019;ll typically be using your car for and base your decision on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_the_advantage_of_a_Hatchback\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the advantage of a Hatchback?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hatchbacks have a distinct advantage over sedans in that they&#x2019;re generally more fuel-efficient, have more cargo space, and (perhaps most importantly) are easier to get into. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need a car to haul around friends and kids regularly, a hatchback might be a good option for you. That said, if you&#x2019;re looking for something elegant and stylish for your daily commute or weekend adventures, a sedan may be better. Then again&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there are always exceptions! Read on to learn more about hatchbacks vs sedans; hopefully, we can help you make an informed decision that works best for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_the_advantage_of_the_Sedan\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the advantage of the Sedan?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first advantage of a sedan over a hatchback would be much better storage capacity. The storage space in sedans has always been more roomy and comfortable to use, making it easier for you to fit your luggage or items inside with minimal issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This will make things convenient for you if you travel around more often with larger items that you need in your car. When compared to its counterpart, sedans also offer better ergonomics while driving. This makes them more suitable for family vehicles <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">where both adults and children can easily get in and out of it without any hassle. This will give you an added convenience on those days when everyone wants to travel together as well as keep everyone safe while they&#8217;re inside your vehicle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_are_Hatchbacks_more_expensive_than_Sedans\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why are Hatchbacks more expensive than Sedans?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s all about supply and demand. Hatchbacks are typically much less popular than sedans, so manufacturers must build fewer of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That makes each one a little more expensive to build&#x2014;and that means you can expect to pay more for your ride! And while some consumers will be willing to pay extra for more space, you may find that a sedan has all of your needs covered.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Are_Hatchbacks_more_fuel-efficient\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are Hatchbacks more fuel-efficient?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This really depends on how you&#x2019;re driving and what kind of car you get. Overall, hatchbacks aren&#x2019;t necessarily more fuel-efficient than their sedan counterparts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, they tend to be more aerodynamic and, therefore, easier to handle on both flat roads and downhills. In particular, hatchbacks can be a better fit for city drivers because they offer more maneuverability in tight spaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That being said, I personally find that buying a larger sedan means I don&#x2019;t have to constantly worry about dings or scratches while parallel parking.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Which_is_the_best_Hatchback_to_buy\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is the best Hatchback to buy?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hatchbacks offer some cool features, but there are also a lot of things you should consider before buying one. The main reason people buy a hatchback car over a sedan is that they like how it looks or they think it&#x2019;s more fun to drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While that might be true, not all hatchbacks have similar power, safety, and performance options. When shopping for your next car, take time to shop around for different makes and models of hatchbacks so you can find which one fits your lifestyle best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This way you know what to expect from each model before making an offer on a vehicle. Look online for reviews from other buyers and make sure you try out at least five different vehicles that fit your budget before making any purchase decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Does_a_Hatchback_have_more_room\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does a Hatchback have more room?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hatchbacks, you say? Aren&#x2019;t those just glorified station wagons that weigh a metric ton? And aren&#x2019;t sedans more popular with normal people, anyway? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From what we hear about hatchbacks (and hatches for that matter), it seems like they are mini-minivans at best and impractical monsters at worst. Of course, <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not all hatches or sedans are created equal, so let&#x2019;s take a look at some of their differences and similarities to see which car type would be right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cars come in many shapes and sizes, but the two most popular vehicle types are hatchbacks and sedans.
