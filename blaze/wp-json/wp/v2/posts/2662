owner should know<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here we are going to have a look at the basic car knowledge of these 5 things that every car owner should have:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Spare_Tyre\"><\/span><b>Spare Tyre<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most basic things that any car owner should know is how to keep a spare tyre in the automobile. The spare tyre, of course, comes in handy whenever you get a flat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, it is critical for a vehicle owner to become familiar with the tools required to change the wheel.&#xA0;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s also critical to keep the spare wheel in good working order.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which includes making sure the tyre is properly inflated and free of any cracks or bulges. The jack is the most important part of the wheel change because it manages the vehicle&#8217;s total weight for you. As a result, ensure that it is in good functioning order.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Car_Fluids\"><\/span><b>Car Fluids<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s not just the engine oil that needs to be looked after. Many additional fluids should be updated or topped up at the specified intervals by the manufacturer. The following are the five most important automotive fluids:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engine Oil<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coolant<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Power Steering Fluid<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brake Fluid<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windshield Washer Fluid<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Engine_Oil\"><\/span><b>Engine Oil<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engine oil completely overlooks the importance of oil in the lubrication, cooling, and cleaning of your car&#8217;s engine. As a result, not using the proper engine oil grade and quantity will result in three things:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> thermal degradation (lacquer and carbonaceous deposits), oxidation (varnish and sludge), and compressive heating (soot and tar).&#xA0;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These items will accumulate in your car&#8217;s engine, generating friction between critical components. As a result, there will be more wear and tear, resulting in lower mileage and unscheduled repair.&#xA0;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Wiper_Blades_for_Windshields\"><\/span><b>Wiper Blades for Windshields<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping the windshield wiper blades in good condition is one of the most basic things to know about autos. Those who have driven in the rain with worn-out wiper blades understand the aggravation that faulty wipers can cause.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Wiper blades are one of the most important components of a car that many drivers overlook until they are forced to drive in the rain with an obstructive windscreen.&#xA0;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wiper blades, on average, lose their effectiveness after six months. It&#8217;s worth noting that the rubber on your wiper blades tends to harden as a result of the high temperatures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they&#8217;re exposed when your automobile is parked in the sun. The windshield is not thoroughly cleaned with harder rubber.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Tyre_Pressure\"><\/span><b>Tyre Pressure&#xA0;<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how powerful your car&#8217;s engine is, the tyres are the ones who put that power down on the road. Unfortunately,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the tyre of a car is still one of the most disregarded components by most drivers. One of the most efficient strategies to extend the life of your tyres is to maintain proper tyre pressure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyre maintenance is also fundamental automobile knowledge. Many car owners believe that overinflation can improve handling while also increasing fuel efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overinflation, on the other hand, causes accelerated wear and tear. Overinflation causes a rough ride and puts more strain on the suspension components. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While overinflated tyres may result in somewhat lower fuel usage, the numerous drawbacks are not worth it. Underinflation causes decreased performance, increased fuel consumption, and greater tyre wear and tear.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Basic_knowledge_of_car_parts\"><\/span><b>Basic knowledge of car parts<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having knowledge about basic car parts is equally important as having knowledge about the other things of a car. Let&#8217;s have a look at some of those:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:<a href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/best-resale-value-cars-in-india\/\">https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/best-resale-value-cars-in-india\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Engine\"><\/span><b>Engine<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An automobile&#8217;s engine is its beating heart. It is a vehicle&#8217;s powertrain. It&#8217;s also known as an IC engine (Internal Combustion Engine). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The car is propelled by the combustion of an air-fuel mixture and the conversion of that energy into mechanical energy. Other components of an engine include pistons, camshafts, crankshafts, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Clutch\"><\/span><b>Clutch<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clutch, in simple terms, serves as a link between the engine and the transmission. It aids in the engagement and disengagement of the power transfer to the gearbox. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it another way, the clutch assists in stopping the wheels from rotating without turning off the engine. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clutch pedal, clutch plates, a flywheel, and other components make up the clutch system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a manual transmission, the driver must manually engage the clutch. In an automated transmission, the clutch is controlled by the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Transmission\"><\/span><b>Transmission<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A car&#8217;s transmission, commonly known as a gearbox, is an important component. It is the component that distributes the engine&#8217;s energy to the wheels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It consists of a succession of gears with varying ratios. Depending on the driving conditions, the driver can select a smaller or larger gear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, manual and automatic transmissions are available. The driver can shift speeds manually using a manual transmission. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automatic transmissions, on the other hand, make the gear shifts for you. CVT, DCT, and other automatic gearboxes are examples.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Alternator\"><\/span><b>Alternator<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The alternator both charges the battery and provides electricity to the vehicle&#8217;s electrical system. The mechanical energy created by the car&#8217;s movement is used by an alternator to generate electricity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It uses an alternating current to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. The alternator may be at blame for some battery problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Battery\"><\/span><b>Battery<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The automobile battery is the component that first powers the vehicle. The automobile will not start without it. It turns chemical energy into electrical energy to supply the engine and other electrical components with the power they require.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A battery is required to start the engine because it also powers the starter motor. The battery is usually found under the hood, in the engine bay. The positive (+) and negative (-) markings on the terminals make it easy to identify the battery.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Car_engine_basic_knowledge\"><\/span><b>Car engine basic knowledge<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we all know, the engine is the heart of a car. Therefore, having basic knowledge about your car&#8217;s engine is vital for every car owner. Let&#8217;s have a look at some basic car engine knowledge:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cylinder_Block\"><\/span><b>Cylinder Block<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An engine&#8217;s basis is the engine block. Although most engine blocks are made of aluminium alloy, certain manufacturers still employ iron. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the many holes or tubes called cylinders that are cast into the integrated construction, the engine block is also known as the cylinder block.&#xA0;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pistons of the engine slide up and down in the cylinder. An engine&#8217;s power increases as the number of cylinders increases. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ducts and tunnels are built into the block in addition to the cylinders, allowing oil and coolant to flow to various areas of the engine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Combustion_Chamber\"><\/span><b>Combustion Chamber&#xA0;<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an engine, the magic happens in the combustion chamber. It&#8217;s the point at which fuel, air, pressure, and energy combine to create a little explosion that propels the car&#8217;s pistons up and down, generating the power to move the vehicle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The cylinder serves as the combustion chamber&#8217;s wall, the piston&#8217;s top serves as the combustion chamber&#8217;s floor, and the cylinder head serves as the combustion chamber&#8217;s ceiling.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Piston\"><\/span><b>Piston<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pistons resemble soup cans turned upside down. When the fuel in the combustion chamber ignites, the force pushes the piston downward, which causes the crankshaft to rotate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A connecting rod, often known as the con rod, connects the piston to the crankshaft. A piston pin connects it to the connecting rod, which in turn connects to the crankshaft through a connecting rod bearing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three or four grooves are cast into the metal on the top of the piston. Piston rings are inserted into the grooves. The piston rings are the parts of the piston that make contact with the cylinder walls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Compression rings and oil rings are two types of compression rings composed of iron. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The top rings are the compression rings, which press outward on the cylinder walls to form a strong seal for the combustion chamber. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom ring of a piston is the oil ring, which keeps oil from the crankcase from entering the combustion chamber. Excess oil is also wiped down the cylinder walls and into the crankcase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cylinder_Head\"><\/span><b>Cylinder Head<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cylinder head is a metal component that sits on top of the engine&#8217;s cylinders. Small, rounded indentations are cast into the cylinder head to make room for combustion at the top of the chamber. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The junction between the cylinder head and the cylinder block is sealed by a head gasket. The cylinder head also houses the intake and exhaust valves, spark plugs, and fuel injectors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Crankshaft\"><\/span><b>Crankshaft<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crankshaft is responsible for converting the pistons&#8217; up and down motion into rotational motion, which allows the car to drive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crankshaft usually fits near the bottom of the engine block, longitudinally. It stretches from one end to the other of the engine block. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crankshaft connects to rubber belts that connect to the camshaft and supply power to various elements of the car at the front end of the engine; the camshaft connects to the drive train at the back end of the engine, <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which distributes power to the wheels. Oil seals, often known as &#8220;O-rings,&#8221; are located at each end of the crankshaft and prevent oil from leaking out of the engine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On an engine, the crankshaft is located in the crankcase. Underneath the cylinder block lies the crankcase. Outside items are protected from the crankshaft and connecting rods by the crankcase. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your engine&#8217;s oil is stored in the oil pan, which is located at the bottom of the crankcase. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An oil pump is located inside the oil pan, and it pushes oil through a filter before squirting it on the crankshaft,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> connecting rod bearings, and cylinder walls to lubricate the piston stroke action. The oil ultimately drips back into the oil pan, starting the process all over again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balancing lobes run the length of the crankshaft, acting as counterweights to keep the crankshaft balanced and avoid engine damage from wobbling as it rotates. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major bearings are also located along with the crankshaft. The main bearings offer a smooth surface for the crankshaft to spin on between the engine block and the crankshaft.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Buying a car has never been easier, thanks to a large range of alternatives, rising purchasing power, and simple financing options.
