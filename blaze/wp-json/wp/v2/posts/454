Some people like to have the showroom finish all year round and go for the recommended range of every four to six months while others either choose to get it done once every year or maybe even never.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One cannot change their mind based on what the recommended range is. But it may be intriguing to know why it is important to have your car waxed periodically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having your car polished and painted is no less than bringing a brand new car home. Though, it would be incomplete if there was nothing preserving that fresh clear coat of the paintwork. A car wax not only helps in protecting a body&#x2019;s paintwork but also affords a glossy finish to the overall shine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a car wash is generally required on a daily basis to keep your car clean and hygienic, wax on the other hand is a more robust coating, protecting your car against blights and rust. When the wax starts to fade in its effects, the vehicle&#x2019;s paint becomes vulnerable to all sorts of things that can tarnish the finish of your car. So, what does the car wax process exactly involve and how is it different from car washing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we delve deep into the topic of a clear coat let&#x2019;s understand more about car wax-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_50 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wax-a-new-car\/#What_is_a_Car_Wax\" title=\"What is a Car Wax\">What is a Car Wax<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wax-a-new-car\/#How_Often_Should_You_Wax_Your_Car\" title=\"How Often Should You Wax Your Car?\">How Often Should You Wax Your Car?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wax-a-new-car\/#How_To_Tell_When_Your_Car_Needs_Waxed\" title=\"How To Tell When Your Car Needs Waxed?\">How To Tell When Your Car Needs Waxed?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wax-a-new-car\/#How_To_Extend_The_Lifespan_Of_Wax\" title=\"How To Extend The Lifespan Of Wax?\">How To Extend The Lifespan Of Wax?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wax-a-new-car\/#When_Should_A_New_Car_Be_Waxed\" title=\"When Should A New Car Be Waxed?\">When Should A New Car Be Waxed?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wax-a-new-car\/#When_Can_I_Wax_A_Freshly_Painted_Car\" title=\"When Can I Wax A Freshly Painted Car?\">When Can I Wax A Freshly Painted Car?<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_a_Car_Wax\"><\/span>What is a Car Wax<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wax is a protective coating made from a natural compound carnauba wax (from a Brazilian palm tree) and other types of natural and synthetic polymers that provide exemplary detail and shine to the paintwork that is otherwise impossible to achieve. Another product on the market today is a paint sealant. A paint sealant is similar to wax but is a completely synthetic blend of polymers made by chemists. Both products enhance the appearance of your car and protect it from the elements such as acid rain, road salt, UV rays, corrosion, tar, bug guts, and bird droppings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Characteristics of Each:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wax:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Warm Shine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Adds Depth to the Paint<\/li><li>Shorter Life Span (1-3 months)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sealant:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Slick, Glassy Finish<\/li><li>Increases Gloss<\/li><li>Long-Lasting (6-12 months)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Often_Should_You_Wax_Your_Car\"><\/span>How Often Should You Wax Your Car?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Waxing a car is generally recommended every 5-6 months, though this period depends on a number of things, from the change of seasons, type of paint used to human err and even sun exposure. To better understand and properly assess your paint requirement, you can use the two methods for testing how often you should wax your car- Surface check and Bead Test.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Tell_When_Your_Car_Needs_Waxed\"><\/span>How To Tell When Your Car Needs Waxed?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" src=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed-768x430.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed-850x476.jpg 850w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed-36x20.jpg 36w, https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/18840485120_34d6e1646a_b-compressed-48x27.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to check if your car needs to be waxed. The first method is to, feel the surface of your car&#x2019;s paint. Does it feel rough and gritty? If so, you should get your car waxed or at the very least have it washed. The second way is to test a small area of the car (let&#x2019;s say the bonnet). You can test for this by pouring a small amount of water on the area to see if water beads on the surface.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note- Clean the selected area first as dirt and contamination sitting on top of the wax can prevent the water from beading and provide inaccurate results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Extend_The_Lifespan_Of_Wax\"><\/span>How To Extend The Lifespan Of Wax?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Car waxes have a lifespan of 1-3 months and sealants of about 6-12 months. Several factors come into play when determining how long a product will last. First, make sure your car&#x2019;s paint is completely clean. Give your car a thorough wash and then feel the surface of the paint again. If it still feels dirty or gritty, it&#x2019;s an indication that there are bonded contaminants on the surface that can only be removed by using auto detailing clay. It&#x2019;s incredibly important to apply wax to a clean surface because the products are made to bond to paint, not to dirt and contamination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once, you have a completely clean surface make sure you apply the product correctly and evenly. Generally, the manufacturer knows their product the best and it&#x2019;s a good practice to read the instructions for the product application and their estimated product lifespan will be listed on the label.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A car cover is a great way to store a car long-term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor lifespan factor is the climate and how your car is stored. The less time your car spends out in the elements and in the sun the better. Hot and humid climates really take a toll on wax and can drastically shorten its lifespan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"When_Should_A_New_Car_Be_Waxed\"><\/span>When Should A New Car Be Waxed?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do new cars need to be waxed? Yes, new cars are no exception. The best way to keep your car looking brand new is to keep it protected from the elements. Think back to the beach trip example. The best way to protect your skin from the sun is to apply sunscreen and stay in the shade; both apply to protecting your new car.If possible keep your car out of the sun as much as possible and always keep it waxed. A regularly washed and waxed car will stay looking brand new years longer than if you just washed your car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"When_Can_I_Wax_A_Freshly_Painted_Car\"><\/span>When Can I Wax A Freshly Painted Car?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next wax of a freshly painted car is determined by the type of paint the auto body painter used. It&#x2019;s best to contact the painter and follow their recommendation, as they will know their paint product the best. If you&#x2019;re unable to get in touch with the painter a general rule of thumb is to wait 90 days. It&#x2019;s also recommended that you only wash the car with water and immediately get any dirt, tar, sap, bug guts, bird droppings, etc. off the paint to prevent any paint defects.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The interval you choose for getting your car waxed is really your own decision.
