Feel free to make yourself comfortable, it&#8217;s your car and you don&#8217;t want to drive in such a way you don&#8217;t get the proper view or feel. Then comes our side Mirrors for safety measures, it&#8217;s a good habit to check all your mirrors while you drive to get a better understanding of people and vehicles on your left and right as well as at your back. So make sure to adjust them when you start your Journey for a safe drive.

I can give you so many reasons for it to be considered that way. It shows that you are not a responsible person. You don&#8217;t ensure your safety as well as other people on road. Neither are you a good Driver if you do that. When drunk you would definitely speed up, unnecessary overtaking will happen for sure and you will get easily offended if someone overtakes you and many more reasons. If you drink and drive you are not following road safety and traffic rules and that&#8217;s not safe for you and the other people on the roads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Always wear Seat Belts<\/strong>:- When you sit in a car the first thing we should do is to put the seat belt on, traffic rule number One. Saving lives is the ultimate goal in ensuring safety in any aspect you know whether it is Road Safety or something else that&#8217;s why we have traffic rules. There are many studies tells that more than 60% of life death situations in a road accident were prevented just by the use of Seat Belts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Over Speeding on Road is Dangerous<\/strong>:- Here and there everyone does this please don&#8217;t disagree because that&#8217;s the reason we love Sports Cars so much. You can&#8217;t control car at high speed. Please make it clear that you are not driving a racing Car and it&#x2019;s not a Race Track. Even the Safest Car in the world can&#8217;t be driven like they drive on the race track, there is always lots of traffic and a lot of other things that make it different to drive on a simple road. In India, we drive like Crazy, not just a few people but most of us Considering that we should keep our speed in check and our Car in Control.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never use Smart phone while Driving<\/strong>:-&#xA0;According to my Mother everything bad that happens to me is because of my phone, Well Mom you are partially right in this case, I promise I will stop my car if I have to use my Phone or I will not use my smart phone while driving. Some silly mistakes should not be done to avoid breaking traffic rules and accidents.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Focus<\/strong>:- While driving if you focus on one thing that is the worst mistake that a driver can do, Weather it is something on the road that you focus on for more than 2-3 Seconds or it&#8217;s your phone that&#8217;s keeping you engaged.

See both your hands are on steering if you do that and you can control your car in the most efficient way if you do that.
