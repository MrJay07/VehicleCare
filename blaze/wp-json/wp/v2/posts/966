A sudden malfunction can be due to many different reasons but most commonly, it can be a result of bad service history.&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like your car, your AC also needs to be serviced periodically to maintain its healthy functioning. It has about the same service interval as a car but people often choose to skip it, not knowing what goes in a periodic car AC service. The air conditioning system in a modern vehicle has various different components that work together to provide the cool air we can&#x2019;t live without in the months of summer. So if your car AC is not working correctly and is not blowing cold air as it used to here are some of the possible reasons that could be causing it &#8211;&#xA0;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_50 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Low_Refrigerant_%E2%80%93\" title=\"Low Refrigerant &#8211;&nbsp;\">Low Refrigerant &#8211;&nbsp;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Mold_Build_%E2%80%93_Up_%E2%80%93\" title=\"Mold Build &#8211; Up &#8211;&nbsp;\">Mold Build &#8211; Up &#8211;&nbsp;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Bad_AC_Clutch_Cycling_Switch_%E2%80%93\" title=\"Bad AC Clutch Cycling Switch &#8211;\">Bad AC Clutch Cycling Switch &#8211;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Clogged_Cabin_Air_Filter_%E2%80%93\" title=\"Clogged Cabin Air Filter &#8211;\">Clogged Cabin Air Filter &#8211;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Electrical_Problems_%E2%80%93\" title=\"Electrical Problems &#8211;\">Electrical Problems &#8211;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Blocked_Condenser_%E2%80%93\" title=\"Blocked Condenser &#8211;&nbsp;\">Blocked Condenser &#8211;&nbsp;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Bad_Compressor_%E2%80%93\" title=\"Bad Compressor &#8211;\">Bad Compressor &#8211;<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/vehiclecare.in\/blaze\/reasons-why-your-car-ac-is-not-cooling-like-it-used-to\/#Affordable_Car_AC_Repair_In_India\" title=\"Affordable Car AC Repair In India&nbsp;\">Affordable Car AC Repair In India&nbsp;<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Low_Refrigerant_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Low Refrigerant &#8211;&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common reasons for car AC not cooling enough is low levels of refrigerant in the system. Typically, the AC loses roughly around 10% of its total freon level, but this can be made worse significantly if the system has other problems lying under the rack such as a leak or condenser issues. A refrigerant leak is perhaps the most common reason for ac blowing hot air as it is what mainly produces the cooling effect. Leaks usually develop at the connecting hoses carrying the refrigerant. These can run from the AC to the back of the vehicle where you can look to see for puddles of such liquid. If you could find the chapped hose where the leak is coming from, you could try and fix it with a sealant though it is recommended to get a replacement so it doesn&#8217;t happen again soon after.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mold_Build_%E2%80%93_Up_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Mold Build &#8211; Up &#8211;&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another possible reason for your car AC not blowing cold air could be the presence of festering bacteria inside your AC cabin. This type of issue usually comes about in the months of monsoon when the weather is a bit damp and moisture is easy to make its way inside the cabin. Mold and bacteria can easily spoil the ambience of your cabin with foul smells and health hazards but they can be even more detrimental to the health of your AC system. Mould buildup can affect many different components in the AC and consequently bring hefty repair bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bad_AC_Clutch_Cycling_Switch_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Bad AC Clutch Cycling Switch &#8211;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The clutch cycling switch is a vital component in the Air conditioning system of a vehicle. It is responsible for monitoring and maintaining a predefined pressure of freon in the system. It is located on the low pressure side of the AC from where it monitors the flow of refrigerant. In case the pressure of refrigerant falls below the threshold limit, the clutch cycling switch compensates for the pressure loss by turning the high pressure side of the system. For optimum cooling performance from the AC, there needs to be a consistent level of freon circulation in the levels. If the cycling switch fails to equalize the low and high pressure, the AC may not function as normal and fail to blow cold air.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Clogged_Cabin_Air_Filter_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Clogged Cabin Air Filter &#8211;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the regular air filter that cleans the air entering into the engine, the cabin air filter catches dirt and dust particles from getting inside the air conditioning system and helps in flow of healthy cool air.&nbsp; However being a part that helps clean out the AC operations for normal functioning, the cabin air filter requires replacement at regular intervals. It can accrue dirt overtime and sometimes even catch larger debris that may act as a blockage. A clogged cabin air filter can lead to decreased air flow and decreased cooling performance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Electrical_Problems_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Electrical Problems &#8211;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an electrically run component, the AC is quite commonly swayed by problems with wiring, fuses, power and more. The car AC is powered by the alternator when it is not drawing current from the battery and consumes a significant amount of power. Any type of hindrance in the power supply can reduce the cooling performance&nbsp; of the car AC.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electrical problems on their own can be particularly hard to put a finger on as they generally affect the whole system and cannot be probed without specialized equipment. Issues such as bad wiring, blown fuses or low output can also be one reason why your car AC is not blowing cold air.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Blocked_Condenser_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Blocked Condenser &#8211;&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A bad or blocked condenser is another top reason for car AC not blowing cold air as it is responsible for condensing and processing the freon from gaseous to liquid form. It converts the refrigerant to its cooled form so that it could function as the cooling agent in the air condition system. When the condenser is not doing its, you will most likely feel room temperature air coming from the vents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bad_Compressor_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Bad Compressor &#8211;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Refrigerant is the blood of the cooling system, when it is in its liquid state. It is constantly being compressed into gaseous form then turned to liquid. This cycle is maintained by the compressor which converts the refrigerant so it could be released with pressure.&nbsp; If the refrigerant is not being compressed properly, it will not be able to circulate and provide optimum cooling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Affordable_Car_AC_Repair_In_India\"><\/span>Affordable Car AC Repair In India&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering what your next step should be?
